# Local reduced-order models

Local ROMs enable to better approximated the solution of parametrized (nonlinear) time-dependent problems in a lower-dimensional subspace generated by local basis vectors, rather than in a unique subspace spanned by global basis vectors. In our work, we have performed several numerical tests dealing with the monodomain equation coupled with the Aliev-Panfilov ionic model in several parameter-dependent scenarios. In particular, we have compared a local ROM built through a *k-means* clustering in the state space of the snapshots with three alternative local ROMs (time-, parameter- and state-based).
