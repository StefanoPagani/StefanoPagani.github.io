# Local reduced-order models

Local ROMs enable to better approximate the solution of parametrized (nonlinear) time-dependent problems in a lower-dimensional subspace generated by local basis vectors, rather than in a unique subspace spanned by global basis vectors. In our work, we have performed several numerical tests dealing with the monodomain equation coupled with the Aliev-Panfilov ionic model in several parameter-dependent scenarios. In particular, we have compared a local ROM built through a *k-means* clustering in the state space of the snapshots with three alternative local ROMs (time-, parameter- and state-based).

# Inverse (backward UQ) problems

A growing number of applications in computational science and engineering are bringing new challenges dealing with the integration of high-dimensional and complex data (possibly affected by uncertainty) within mathematical models built on partial differential equations.
Backward uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems involve parameter (and state) estimation and data assimilation in view of both model calibration and personalization. In this context, Bayesian methods provide a rigorous framework for the solution of backward UQ problems: sampling algorithms, such as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or the (ensemble) Kalman filter, enable to estimate the distribution of quantities of interest (model parameters, state of a system) from noisy measurements. Adopting Bayesian methods is much costly compared to deterministic optimization procedure, which however neglect the presence of uncertainties. To apply them to complex full-order models with possibly large parameter space, new efficient reduction methods, combining statistical and numerical tools, have been developed in our works.
