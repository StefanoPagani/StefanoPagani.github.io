# About

I'm a post-doctoral researcher focusing on numerical analysis and data science.

My research activity concentrates on developing **reduced-order models** for the efficient solution of **uncertainty quantification** and **inverse problems**. The numerical models, such as the ones arising from the discretization of *partial differential equations*, could be affected by a significant amount of uncertainties related e.g. to both physical and geometrical parameters. Developing uncertainty quantification and inverse techniques is thus crucial for a personalization of these models. My main interests concern the development of engineering applications, such as cardiac electrophysiology and mechanics.

In February 2017, I received my PhD in Mathematical Models and Methods in Engineering from Politecnico di Milano University, under the supervision of Prof. Alfio Quarteroni. My thesis, entitled [Reduced-order models for inverse problems and uncertainty quantification in cardiac electrophysiology](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/131411/1/2017_02_PhD_Pagani.pdf), regards the development of reduced-order models for the efficient and accurate solution of uncertainty quantification and inverse problems arising in cardiac electrophysiology. From 2017 to April 2018, I was a post-doctoral researcher at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch). I have joined the [iHEART project](http://iheart.polimi.it) as a post-doctoral researcher in May 2018.
